2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1571#1 Warning
connects_D  
The FDRE cell vio/inst/PROBE_IN_INST/probe_in_reg_reg[0] has no driver for the D input pin. To protect against unwanted transitions in all flows, the D input pin is required to have a driver. To resolve this violation, modify the design so that the D input pin has an active signal or constant logic-level tie-off.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1571#2 Warning
connects_D  
The FDRE cell vio/inst/PROBE_IN_INST/probe_in_reg_reg[8] has no driver for the D input pin. To protect against unwanted transitions in all flows, the D input pin is required to have a driver. To resolve this violation, modify the design so that the D input pin has an active signal or constant logic-level tie-off.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1571#3 Warning
connects_D  
The FDRE cell vio/inst/PROBE_IN_INST/probe_in_reg_reg[9] has no driver for the D input pin. To protect against unwanted transitions in all flows, the D input pin is required to have a driver. To resolve this violation, modify the design so that the D input pin has an active signal or constant logic-level tie-off.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>

# Lab Report Requirement
### Chang Liu

Hi all,

We will still follow the previous lab deliverables for all upcoming lab reports. Contents include:

  1) Code of your unit design 

  2) Code of your testbench

  3) Screenshot of the waveform of your simulation

  4) Video of your hardware test 

1)-3) should be combined into a single document (e.g word or pdf). Please do not take screenshots for your code 1)-2) and do not provide the raw .v file.  Just copy your code into that document.  Any violation of the format above might lead to a point deduction. I would strictly follow this grading rule starting from lab 3, so there will not be any excuses after this.
